# PyArch

PyArch is an arch-inspired distro with a few things slimmed down.

It also requires colorama to highlight some stuff :3

It's not done yet, but I sorta use github to backup my file y'know?

put all the .py files that arent pyarch.py in a folder in the same directory you put pyarch and name that folder colorama, this should minimize colorama jank
